# Selenium is a widely used tool
    Selenium is a widely used tool in the software testing industry for automating web browser interactions.
    Here are some common use cases for Selenium:

# Functional Testing: 
    Selenium can be used to automate functional testing of web applications. It can simulate user interactions 
    with the web application, such as clicking on buttons, entering data into forms, and navigating through web pages.

# Regression Testing: 
    Selenium can be used to automate regression testing of web applications. It can run a suite of automated tests 
    to ensure that changes made to the web application do not break existing functionality.

# Cross-browser Testing: 
    Selenium can be used to test web applications across different browsers and browser versions. 
    It can help ensure that the web application works correctly and consistently across all targeted browsers.

# Performance Testing:
    Selenium can be used to measure the performance of web applications by automating user interactions and
    measuring the response time of the web application.

# Data Scraping: 
    Selenium can be used for web scraping, which involves extracting data from websites. It can automate the 
    process of navigating to web pages, extracting data from HTML elements, and storing the data in a structured format.



# How to Download & Install Selenium WebDriver:
    To download and install Selenium WebDriver, you can follow these steps:

    Go to the official Selenium website:
>>https://www.selenium.dev/downloads/

    and download the latest version of the WebDriver for your preferred programming 
    language and browser. WebDriver is available for Java, Python, C#, Ruby, JavaScript, 
    and others.
for python:
>>https://pypi.org/project/selenium/

    After downloading the WebDriver, extract the downloaded file to a specific location on
    your computer. Open your Integrated Development Environment (IDE), such as Eclipse, 
    IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm, or Visual Studio Code.


If the Selenium version you are using is v4.6.0 or above (which I think it is as I see 
SeleniumManger in the error trace), then you don't really have to set the driver.exe path. 
Selenium can handle the browser and drivers by itself.So your code can be simplified as below:

        from selenium import webdriver
        
        driver = webdriver.Chrome()
        driver.get("https://www.google.com/")
        driver.quit()
